# scripTool  

GUI-based script expansion and reconstruction tool for THE IDOLM@STER SP.

## Important  

This application requires ActivePerl and Strawberry Perl to be installed.  
Please note that the application will not run without them installed.  
This is because Perl scripts are used to extract and rebuild script files.  

[ActivePerl](https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/)  
[Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/)  

## Details  

Script files can be expanded or rebuilt.
This may be useful for translation work, for example.

## Be sure to purchase an authorized ROM and suck it out.  

Do not obtain archive files by unauthorized means.  
For example, download ROMs that have fallen off the Web and extract the files.  
Also, do not publish or distribute the scripts deployed by this application on the Web or elsewhere.  
**Those can be serious offenses.**  

This application is not designed to facilitate them.  
If these things are ignored, the producer assumes no responsibility.
